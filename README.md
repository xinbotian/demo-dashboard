The Demo Dashboard is a web-based application designed to provide real-time insights into cryptocurrency prices, market trends, and portfolio management. The dashboard aggregates data from popular cryptocurrency APIs, allowing users to monitor their favorite cryptocurrencies, track price changes, and manage a demo portfolio with no real financial risk.

This project is intended as a demo to showcase the functionality of a modern cryptocurrency dashboard, including the integration of external APIs, data visualization, and responsive user interfaces.
